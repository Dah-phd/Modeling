#STATISTIC MODULES TIME SERIES

A library of statistical analysis, circling around prediction
It includes:
============
data processing:
    Stationarity checks and data integration
prediction:
    ARIMA
    Linear projection
    AR - under construction
    MA - under construction

work in progress, plans:
    ATM all prediction functions are operational but not tested enough
    so multiple calc could be done at one time, such as solving ARIMA or AutoRs ... etc
